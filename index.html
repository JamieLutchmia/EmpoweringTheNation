                            <b>We are local SME initiated by Precious Radebe, dedicated to providing skills training for domestic workers and gardeners in the community. Inspired by the lack of educational opportunities for her parents and elderly relatives, Precious aims to empower individuals through skills development. 
                            Our platform serves as a hub for advertising the SME's services, facilitating information requests from potential customers, and providing quotes for requested services. Through our initiatives, domestic workers and gardeners receive valuable training, making them more employable and enabling them to command higher wages. 
                            <br/><br/>Additionally, they have the opportunity to become entrepreneurs and start their own small businesses, thus contributing to the economic growth of the community. Employers seeking skilled services for household needs can also benefit from our platform by upskilling their employees through our training programs.</b>
